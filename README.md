Scope of Work (SOW)
Project Overview
Name: Healthcare System
Objective: Develop a healthcare platform to connect individuals needing healthcare with relevant services and providers.
Deliverables:
1. Mobile Apps: Android and iOS applications for patients and providers.
2. Web App: A responsive web platform with administrative and user functionalities.
Technical Stack
| SN | Technology | Purpose                |
|----|------------|------------------------|
| 1  | React      | Frontend framework     |
| 2  | Node.js    | Backend runtime        |
| 3  | TypeScript | Strongly typed JS      |
| 4  | MongoDB    | Database               |
API Design
Style: RESTful APIs with consistent versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
Data Format: JSON.
Security:
- Use HTTPS for all endpoints.
- Token-based authentication (JWT).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user levels.
Error Handling:
- Standard error codes with descriptive messages.
User Interface (UI/UX)
Design Tool: Figma.
Design Process: All UI/UX designs must be approved by the team lead before development.
Accessibility: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 standards to ensure inclusivity.
Responsiveness: Designs must adapt seamlessly to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Collaboration and Version Control
| SN | Rule                                                                 |
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Use Git for version control.                                         |
| 2  | Branch Naming Convention: Use task-specific branches prefixed...    |
| 3  | Main Branch: Reserved for production-ready code.                    |
| 4  | Code Reviews: Developers must request reviews and merging by Leke.  |
| 5  | Process Adherence: Non-compliance will lead to task rejection.      |
Testing Strategy
Initial Testing: Introduced post version 0.0.1 release.
Unit Testing: Required for all new components and features.
Integration Testing: Validate interaction between modules.
Tools:
- Frontend: React Testing Library, Jest.
- Backend: Mocha, Chai, Supertest.
- Mobile: Detox or Appium for end-to-end testing.
Deployment and Scaling
Containerization: Use Docker to package and deploy applications.
CI/CD: Automate builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
Scaling: Implement auto-scaling using Kubernetes or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
API Documentation
Tool: Postman.
Standard: Document all endpoints with examples, expected responses, and error codes.
