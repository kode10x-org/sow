**Error Handling:**  
- Standard error codes with descriptive messages.  

---

## User Interface (UI/UX)
- **Design Tool:** Figma.  
- **Design Process:** All UI/UX designs must be approved by the team lead before development.  
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 standards to ensure inclusivity.  
- **Responsiveness:** Designs must adapt seamlessly to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).  

---

## Testing Strategy
- **Initial Testing:** Introduced post version 0.0.1 release.  
- **Unit Testing:** Required for all new components and features.  
- **Integration Testing:** Validate interaction between modules.  

**Tools:**  
- **Frontend:** React Testing Library, Vitest.  
- **Backend:** Mocha, Chai, Supertest.  
- **Mobile:** Detox or Appium for end-to-end testing.  

---

## Deployment and Scaling
- **Containerization:** Use Docker to package and deploy applications.  
- **CI/CD:** Automate builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins.  
- **Scaling:** Implement auto-scaling using Kubernetes, AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Runners.

## Code Consistency and Automation

| Scope          | Tool       | Purpose                                |
|----------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Linter         | ESLint     | Enforce code quality.                 |
| Formatter      | Prettier   | Maintain consistent code formatting.  |
| Pre-commit     | Husky      | Ensure checks are passed pre-commit.  |

**Rules:**  
1. Pre-commit hooks run ESLint and Prettier to catch issues before pushing.  
2. Modifications to automation configuration files are strictly prohibited.  

## 📍 Collaboration and Version Control / Mono Merger:

| SN  | Rule                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Git version control system for tracking changes.                                                                                           |
| 2   | ⚠️ Developers are to create task-specific branches using their name as a prefix (e.g., lucky-admin-auth-model).                            |
| 3   | ⚠️ The main branch is reserved for production-ready code, with all development updates merged into the dev branch .                        |
| 4   | ⚠️ Developers must request code reviews and merging from the designated merger [Leke](https://github.com/Leyksnal) after completing tasks. |
| 5   | ⚠️ Strict adherence to this process ensures code quality and consistency.                                                                  |
| 6   | ⚠️ Tasks carried out outside this defined scope will be removed or left unattended to maintain project assurance.                          |
